## Course Project:

A two-phase project has been done throughout the semester for this course by Me and Masoud Mousavi as a group. We have chosen several methodologies to prepare and analyze a dataset containing team and player box-scores and used them to predict outcome of matches using two different deep learning models, namely Deep-Set and Blade-Chest.

A Comprehensive project report and a presentation was prepared at the end of each phase. Please refer to these reports for more information.
